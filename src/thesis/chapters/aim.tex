\chapter{Aim of the Thesis}
\label{ch:aim}
The aim of this thesis is to research techniques used in the medical imaging domain and implement my own model for segmentation of organs using neural nets.

In the literature review I will look at the historical milestones that shaped the medical imaging domain. I will introduce techniques for image analysis in medicine popular in the past, as well as those used nowadays. Furthermore I will focus on CT images and the technology behind them. The approach of my choice is convolutional neural networks and their variations that have recently gained popularity. 

The practical part of my work will cover implementing my own prototype model for segmentation tasks over medical images. The data set I will work with consists of CT images of human spines. I will try to segment spine and also specific vertebrae from these images. I will compare my results with results of already existing models, discuss them. My prototype code has to be published and be reproducible.
