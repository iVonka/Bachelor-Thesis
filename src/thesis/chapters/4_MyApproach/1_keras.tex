\section{Keras}
The framework I used is called Keras \cite{keras}. It is a deep learning high-level API in python, which is built on top of either Theano or TensorFlow. It was built with the intent to provide a tool for quick prototyping and experimenting.

I used the TensorFlow \cite{tensorflow} backend.  TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning platform. Its abilities include: executing low level tensor operations on CPU, GPU and TPU, scaling computations to many devices or exporting to external runtimes.
