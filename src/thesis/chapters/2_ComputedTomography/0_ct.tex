\chapter{Computed Tomography}
\label{ch:ct}
Computed tomography was briefly mentioned in the previous chapter. Its invention had a huge impact on the field of diagnosis and rapidly increased in popularity over a few years. Compared to other techniques used in the 1970s, CT scans provided 3D visualisations with high detail.

In my thesis I am working with CT images, so in this chapter I am going to talk about the technology behind producing CT scans and the scans themselves.
